this is a gentoo deployment script created by mental outlaw

- Run setup_gentoo.sh it will prompt you to provision your disk, or you can auto provision using my recommended format
- The script is going to prompt you to answer several questions to configure your installation.  After this the setup will do its thing (it takes several minutes)
- When this finishes you'll have a working gentoo linstallation with my minimal kernel config and use flags, exit the chroot, remove the live cd and reboot.
- From here you could go on and customize gentoo to your liking, or deploy my included "rice" (gui configuration and dotfiles) with sudo deploy_rice.sh. Currently I use dwm, pcmanfm, zsh, bash, and vim.
- You can also run install_software.sh to install a list of software that I use on gentoo.
